### This is my Polybar configuration

I have some specific files to:

- 🔋 Battery module
- 🖌️ Colors
- 💻 CPU module
- 🏗️ All others modules

Also, I have two Bash scripts:

- `cava.sh` to use `cava` software to show a sound bars in status bar
- `updates.sh` to check available updates using `XBPS`

You can just import this files to `$HOME/.config/polybar/` and I think this will works, since you have the correct fonts and packages (you can check the dotfiles to confirm it).

If you need anything, please, open an issue! :)
