### ASDF script

I've created this script, just to get a clean and easy installation.
If you have any questions or suggestion, please, open an issue.

> This script was based to `bash` and `amd64`
> If you need another one, please, check the official wiki of `asdf`.

### Resume

The script will create a new directory in `$HOME/.bin/`, which will be used as default PATH to `asdf` binary. 

The version in the script is: `v0.15.4`.

The temporary directory to download and extract the binary will be deleted, so don't worry about it.

Thank you!
